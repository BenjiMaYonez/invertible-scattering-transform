# Invertible Scattering Transform Project

## Overview

This project extends the functionality of the scattering transform by introducing the concept of an **invertible scattering transform**. It is designed to offer more flexibility and efficiency for tasks like texture reconstruction. The project integrates this new functionality with existing libraries, such as Kymatio, and offers examples for various applications.

## Folder Structure

- **`coefficients_plot/`**: Contains user-generated plots from the `plot_scattering_frequencies.py` script in the `kymatio-main/examples/2d` folder, visualizing the frequencies of the coefficients obtained from the scattering transform.
- **`kymatio-main/`**: Includes the main Kymatio library where modifications were made:
  - **`kymatio/`**: This folder contains the core changes to support the invertible scattering transform.
  - **`examples/`**: This folder contains example scripts demonstrating the use of the invertible scattering transform, including MNIST classification and visualization.
- **`texture_reconstruction/`**: This folder contains modified code for texture reconstruction, using coefficients generated by the `invertibleScattering2d` function.

## Installation Instructions

Ensure that the following dependencies are installed:
- **Kymatio** (with custom modifications)
- **NumPy**
- **PyTorch**
- **MNIST Dataset** (for classification example)

You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy torch
```

## Usage Instructions

### `coefficients_plot` Folder
This folder contains user-generated plots, visualizing the frequencies of the coefficients from the scattering transform.

- The plots are created by running the `plot_scattering_frequencies.py` script in the `kymatio-main/examples/2d` folder.
- The resulting plots are stored as output in this folder.

### `kymatio-main` Folder

This folder includes the modifications to the Kymatio library:
1. **`kymatio/`**: The core changes are in the `scattering2d.py` file where the `invertibleScattering2d` function is added, allowing users to select between the original and invertible scattering transforms.
2. **`examples/`**: This folder contains examples demonstrating the use of the invertible scattering transform:
   - **`check_non_expensiveness.py`**: Assesses the computational cost of the invertible scattering transform.
   - **`plot_scattering_frequencies.py`**: Visualizes the frequencies of the coefficients obtained from the scattering transform.
   - **`long_mnist_classify_torch.py`**: Uses the invertible scattering transform for classifying the MNIST dataset with PyTorch.

### `texture_reconstruction` Folder

This folder contains modified code for texture reconstruction, using the coefficients generated by the `invertibleScattering2d` function.

#### Usage:
1. **Obtain Coefficients**: Generate coefficients using the `invertibleScattering2d` function from the Kymatio modifications.
2. **Run Texture Reconstruction**: Use the texture reconstruction scripts to process these coefficients and perform texture reconstruction. The output will be stored as synthesized texture images in the `texture_reconstruction/synthesized_textures` directory.
